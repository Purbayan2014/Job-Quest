# Job Quest

Welcome to Job Quest - the ultimate job search app for both fresher and experienced professionals!

Job Quest is a React Native mobile application that provides users with an easy-to-use interface to search for their dream job from a vast pool of options. The app features multiple search tags and filters, which makes job searching an effortless experience.

The home page of Job Quest is thoughtfully designed to provide users with two distinct sections - one for fresher jobs and the other for professional jobs. This feature ensures that users can easily search for the most relevant job options without any confusion.

To power our job search, Job Quest uses the Jsearch API from Rapid API, which is a reliable source of job data. This integration allows the app to fetch data from a vast pool of job postings in real-time, which provides users with the latest and most up-to-date job options.

The UI of Job Quest is sleek, clean, and user-friendly, making job searching a fun experience for users. The app has also implemented pagination support for each job search page, ensuring that users can navigate through multiple pages with ease.

Each job listing in Token Trove has several tabs such as qualification, overview, and description, allowing users to view all the necessary details of a job before applying. This feature helps users make an informed decision about whether or not to apply for a particular job.

In summary, Token Trove is an all-in-one job search app that offers a convenient and user-friendly experience for both fresher and professional job seekers. Try it out today and take your first step towards landing your dream job!
